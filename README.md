# RF-Tools for KiCAD (Fork)

**Primarily designed for KiCAD 9 currently. Other versions are considered unsupported.**

## Fork Information
This is a fork of the original RF-Tools repository, which can be found at [https://github.com/easyw/RF-tools-KiCAD]. My goal is to improve KiCAD 9.0 compatibility and refactor the code for better maintainability.

Keep in mind that I am mainly using this for personal use, issues may occur in your environment. I will try and address any issues that may arise though.

## Planned Changes
- [x] Fix WindowList_iterator issue
- [ ] Convert to Poetry project
- [ ] Refactor code
